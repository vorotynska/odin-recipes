        <p>My mom made this broccoli cheese casserole every Thanksgiving when I was little. We kids could never get
            enough!
            If you have <br /> children or have some coming to visit you as guests this Thanksgiving, I guarantee
            that they
            will
            eat (and enjoy) this veggie dish. It's <br /> also fabulous with a Christmas ham.</p>
