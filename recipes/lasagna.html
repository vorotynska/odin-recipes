        <p>This casserole is the perfect winter dinner! It's gone in seconds in my house.<br /> Make sure to use
            whole-milk
            ricotta and use more red <br /> pepper if you like it hotter.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>1 pound ground sirloin</li>
        <l1>1 (12 ounce) box jumbo pasta shellsi </li>
            <li>1 pound Italian sausage, hot or sweet</li>
            <li>1 small yellow onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>6 cloves garlic, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1 (26 ounce) jar prepared marinara sauce</li>
            <li>1 cup loosely packed fresh basil leaves</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>1 (15 ounce) container whole milk ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>¼ cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano plus additional for serving</li>
            <li>¼ cup heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>cooking spray</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Set a rack in the center of the <br /> oven, about 10
            inches
            from the heat source.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add shells and cook, stirring <br /> occasionally, until almost
            tender, about 7 minutes. Scoop out 1/2 cup cooking <br /> water; set aside. Drain pasta in a colander.
            Return to
            pot and toss with 1 <br /> tablespoon oil.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat remaining 3 tablespoons oil in a large Dutch oven over <br /> medium-high heat. Add sirloin
            and
            sausage and cook, undisturbed, until bottom <br /> side is lightly browned, about 6 minutes. Stir, and
            continue to
            cook, stirring and <br /> breaking up meat into smaller pieces with a wooden spoon, until cooked <br />
            through,
            about 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium. Add onion and garlic, and cook, stirring often, until <br /> softened, about 4
            minutes. Stir
            in marinara sauce, basil, and crushed red <br /> pepper. Remove ragu from heat.</li>
        <li>Stir together ricotta, Parmigiano-Reggiano, cream, and salt in a bowl.</li>
        <li>To assemble, spread about 2 cups of the ragu in the bottom of a 13- x 9-inch <br /> baking dish. Spoon 1/2
            of the
            pasta over sauce. Dollop half of the ricotta mixture <br /> over pasta, and sprinkle with 1 cup mozzarella
            cheese.
            Spoon remaining pasta <br /> over mozzarella cheese. Spread remaining ragu over pasta mixture, and dollop
            with
            remaining ricotta mixture. Top with remaining 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese. <br /> Cover lasagna with a
            large sheet of
            aluminum foil that's been lightly sprayed <br /> with cooking spray (to prevent the cheese from sticking to
            it).
        </li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes. Remove from oven and remove foil. <br /> Increase oven temperature to
            broil
            with rack about 10 inches from heat source; <br /> preheat 5 minutes. Return baking dish to oven. Broil
            until
            cheese is browned in <br /> spots, 5 to 8 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
